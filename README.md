# FocusFinder  ✨


FocusFinder is a web application that helps users find a suitable camera based on their preferences, such as skill level, intended use, camera type, and budget.
The application combines a JavaScript front-end with a Node.js + Express backend and a MongoDB database.

## Up & running (optional) 🏃‍➡️
For this project, access to my MongoDB database is required. Since I cannot include database credentials on GitHub, dummy data has been provided so the application can still display content when loading the page.

If you want to use the live backend instead of the dummy data, you will need to update the fetch URL in the JavaScript files:
	•	Use http://localhost:4000/api/photos for photo-related data
	•	Use http://localhost:4000/api/cameras for camera-related data

This depends on which file you are working in and which data is expected to be returned.
